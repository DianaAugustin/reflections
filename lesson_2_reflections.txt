What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a .git folder which will be used to keep track of any 
	commits. It also keeps track of the branch and which file is HEAD. 
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary area to store files that you want to 
	commit. The value is that you can still add or remove files before
	you actually do the commit. It also allows you to pick only the 
	files from your working directory that you want to commit as a 
	single logical commit. It also allows you to see what the difference
	is between the files in the working directory and the staging area,
	as well as the differences between the files in the staging area and
	the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
