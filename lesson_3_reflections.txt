When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You might want to use a remote repository when you are asking others to have
    a look at your code and offer suggestions as to making it better. Also when 
    a group is working on something together would be a good time to have a remote
    repository that you can all add to and access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may want to pull changes manually so that you can have a different version
	of what is on the remote on your local. This allows you to only pull the
	commits you are sure you want to see.
